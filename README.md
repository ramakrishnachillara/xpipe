# XPipe Vault (Keep this repository private!)

The git remote push succeeded. However, no connections have been pushed to this git repository yet.

See below on how to do this.

## Adding categories to the repository

By default, no categories are set to shared so that you have explicit control on what connections to commit.

To have your connections of a category put inside your git repository,
you either need to right-click the category or click on the `⚙️` icon when hovering over the category
in your `Connections` tab under the category overview on the left side.
Then click on `Add to git repository` to sync the category and connections to your git repository.
This will add all shareable connections to the git repository.

## Local connections are not synced

Any connection located under the local machine can not be shared as it refers to connections and data that are only available on the local system.

Certain connections that are based on a local file, for example SSH configs, can be shared via git if the underlying data, in this case the file, have been added to the git repository as well.

## Other issues

If you encounter any other issues, you can try interacting with the cloned repository manually.
You can find it at `%USERPROFILE%\.xpipe\storage\` or `~/.xpipe/storage/`.
XPipe will call your installed git client, so any potential issues with your local git client also transfer to XPipe.

To understand what went wrong, you can also launch XPipe in debug mode at `Settings -> Troubleshoot -> Launch in debug mode`.
This will tell you in detail what git commands are executed.
